TarsosAudioProject basically implements MFCC extraction using TarsosDSP toolkit https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP. 

Other features of this project includes :

* I am also using its PitchDetection feature to show if user is speaking or not. 
* AudioRecording as a background service
* MFCC data is dumped into a CSV file when user decides to stop recording.
